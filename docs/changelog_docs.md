# Changelog

## What is a changelog

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Why keep a changelog

To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

## Who needs a changelog
